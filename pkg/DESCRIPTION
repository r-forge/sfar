Description: Maximum likelihood estimation for stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) of production 
    (profit) and cost functions. 
    The package includes new distributions for the one-sided error term (i.e. rayleigh, 
    gamma, weibull, lognormal, uniform, generalized exponential and truncated skewed Laplace) 
    as well as recent advances like latent class stochastic frontier model (LCM) as discussed in 
    Orea and Kumbhakar (2004) <DOI:10.1007/s00181-003-0184-2>. 
    Several possibilities in terms of optimization algorithms are also proposed. 
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)
