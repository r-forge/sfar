\title{Marginal effects of the determinants of inefficiency}
\usage{
\method{marginal}{sfacross}(object, indataTable = FALSE, ...)

\method{marginal}{lcmcross}(object, indataTable = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A (latent class) stochastic frontier model returned by
\code{\link{sfacross}} or \code{\link{lcmcross}}.}

\item{indataTable}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, marginal effects are returned in
addition to the information in the \code{dataTable} object. When \code{FALSE}
(Default) only the marginal effects are returned.
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Currently ignored.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the marginal effects of the \code{Z} variables
on the expected inefficiency (each variable has the prefix \code{"Eu_"})
and on the variance of the inefficiency (each variable has the prefix
\code{"Vu_"}) is returned.

In the case of the latent class model, each variable terminates with the
suffix \code{"_c#"} where \code{"#"} is the class number.
}
\description{
This function returns marginal effects of the determinants of
efficiency from (Latent class) stochastic frontier models estimated with
\code{\link{sfacross}} or \code{\link{lcmcross}}
}
\details{
The function \code{marginal} operates in the presence of exogenous
variables that explain inefficiency (\eqn{uhet = ~ Z_u} or \eqn{muhet = ~
  Z_{mu}}).

Two components are computed for each variables: the marginal effects on the
expected inefficiency (\eqn{\frac{\partial E[u]}{\partial Z_{(m)u}}}) and the
marginal effects on the variance of inefficiency (\eqn{\frac{\partial
  V[u]}{\partial Z_{(m)u}}}).

The model also accommodates the Wang (2002) parametrization of
\eqn{\mu} and \eqn{\sigma_u^2} by the same vector of exogenous variables.
This double parameterization accounts for non-monotonic relationships
between the inefficiency and its determinants.
